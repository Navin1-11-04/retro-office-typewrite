# Retro Office Typewriter – CSS Art

This is my submission for the [Frontend Challenge: Office Edition](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend/axero), hosted by DEV and sponsored by Axero. The goal was to recreate an office-inspired scene using **only HTML and CSS**.

## Concept

Inspired by retro workspaces, this scene brings together a classic black typewriter, a cozy wooden desk, a steaming coffee mug, and a memo pinned to the wall — all crafted using **pure CSS art and animation**.
